# Filed (wip name)

A simple and fast file manager for Linux, MacOS, and Windows.
It is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, with a focus on speed and efficiency.
Written in Rust using Iced, a cross-platform GUI library.

I've always hated how each file manager was different but I also loved some specific features they had. So I decided to try and combine my favorite features into one file manager that I can use anywhere. To torture myself, I decided to make this in Rust, a brand new language for me. To make it worse, I used Iced for the GUI which is a library that is still in development...

## Features
- [x] File Browsing. Can see all the files inside directories and be able to traverse through directories.
